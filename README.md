# Simple Game Engine

## Description

This simple game engine was created as a project for one of subjects on my university. There is nothing special about it mainly beacause it served as a test ground for my skills in JS and WebGL. Anyway, if you would like to use it for any purposes feel free to fork this repository. This game engine offers basic functions like graphics rendering, oriented box collision, mouse and keyboard input handling, text drawing etc. It works on Electron platform, so game can be build into single package with some third party software like electron-packager.

## API

API itself is quite rouch yet it allows to create simple games. Documentation is available on [api_docs](https://github.com/Next0r/pwag_game/tree/api_docs).

## Creating games

As it was already said, only simple games can be crated (maybe I will push this project a little bit further some day). There is example of a game in form of source code available [here](https://github.com/Next0r/pwag_game/tree/example_game), but if you don't want to set up entire project, you can simply download build [here](https://github.com/Next0r/pwag_game/tree/game_build_only), just run *pwag_game.exe* inside *build* directory.
